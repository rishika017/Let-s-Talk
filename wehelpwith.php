    <h2 align="center">1. Counseling for Relationships</h2>
      <p>Love is enough to sustain a bond between two people- This notion couldn’t be farther from the truth.
      <br>
      Often family bonds deteriorate, friends drift apart and romantic relationships reach a bitter end due to unresolved hurts, unmet needs, disappointments and unrealistic expectations that cause pain and build resentments.
      <br>
      Love is a necessary factor for any relationship be it family, friends or romantic partners but there are certain skills and often some healing that needs to take place to offer consistency, sense of safety and security, healthy communication and boundaries in our relationships. Some we learn with subsequent experiences and introspection, for some, we might need professional help to identify, heal and empower ourselves.
      <br>
      Therapy offers a space where healing, integration and holistic growth can take place for the broken relationships. It helps to explore and understand how unique, subjective elements of each individual personality might be creating friction in the relationship and how to repair the rupture caused due to it.</p>

<h3>How Relationship Counselling Helps:</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
         <li> Explore ideas and patterns of relationships</li>
         <li> Identify met and unmet needs</li>
         <li> Managing expectations</li>
         <li> Work on communication style</li>
         <li> Boundary setting</li>
         <li> Conflict resolution</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
<br>
    <h3>Therapy Approach:</h3>  
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Your counselor will spend the initial part of the therapy in building a rapport with you and giving you a safe, non-judgemental atmosphere to share your challenges.</li>
          <li> The counselor will understand the current concerns, explore the relationship in-depth, identify the areas of work, set goals for therapy.</li>
          <li> Gain an understanding of the patterns of communication, attachment styles, present triggers, unresolved conflicts, unhealed relational wounds and its impact.</li>
          <li> After receiving clarity on the length and breadth of the relationship concern, the Counselor will help to identify whether individual sessions will suffice or there is a need for couples counseling or family therapy as well to find a resolution.</li>
          <li> When do we need individual sessions- When individual personality factors like insecurity, anger outbursts, rigid beliefs, unrealistic expectations, inability to regulate emotions, possessiveness, controlling nature impact the interaction or when a previous trauma continues to trigger us in the present and leads to dysfunctional attachment patterns.</li>
          <li> When do we need couples counseling or family therapy- When two or more people’s communication patterns, belief systems, attachment styles, distress tolerance, needs, expectations, rigid and flexible, imbalance between intimacy and autonomy, boundaries lead to destructive patterns of codependency, enmeshment, toxic relationships that hurt one or all involved.</li>
          <li> The Counselor will help to chart a course of action and step by step take up each problem area of the relationship like controlling behaviour. personality clashes, lack of space, or autonomy, fair fighting, boundary setting and equip you with skills to resolve conflicts change perspectives, find a middle ground or part amicably.</li>
          <li> You may find noticeable changes after a few sessions where you would be able to identify triggers, deal with conflict effectively and are able to break the cycle of negative interactions.</li>
          <li> The aim of the counselor is to empower you in your journey to build healthy relationships with the people you love.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

            <h4>Break Ups</h4>   
         <p>  Many times our love stories do not end in a “happily ever after”. Factors like communication gap, lack of quality time, mistrust, egos, long distance or other conflicts end up breaking relationships and our hearts. In such times, it is very important to understand that time heals all. We can use this time and invest in ourselves. </p>                       
  
            <h4>Lack of Trust in Relationships</h4>  
              <p>We have been together for 4 years now. Most of the times everything is great but the times where he is traveling for work or busy for days, thoughts of him being with another woman fill my head. He reassures me that he is committed to me but even after all this time together, I'm unable to get rid of these doubts. After all he DID have a PAST. I just don't know how to find sanity.</p>

            <h4>Losing The Spark</h4>  
          <p>“It's not like before anymore. We used to plan dates, slow down our day with a quick call to catch up, get upset with each other and spend more time making up for bad words said to each other. Now, we are only hurriedly rushing towards things that don't seem to bring us together at any point in the day.</p>

          <h4>Falling Out of Love</h4>
             <p>A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. Unmanaged conflicts and negative interactions can cause marital conflict. Communication, understanding and objectivity can turn a conflict into a learning experience for the couple and they can bring back the joy in their married life!</p>
  
          <h4>Build a Fulfilling Marriage</h4> 
            <p>A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person. Unmanaged conflicts and negative interactions can cause marital conflict. Communication, understanding and objectivity can turn a conflict into a learning experience for the couple and they can bring back the joy in their married life!</p> 

          <h4>Family Bonds</h4>  
             <p>“The bond that links one’s true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each others life." Family is a unique system that has its own styles of communication and behavior towards its members. Untying knots between family members, communicating and giving space to each other can bring back joy to a family.</p>

          <h4>Dating</h4>
             <p>Romantic relationships are a beautiful experience. However, life is not always about walking over petals of roses. The desire to be accepted and the possibility of rejection can lead to feelings of insecurity and trust issue. Better communication and building trust are the two pillars that will help make your relationships stronger.</p>                   

          <h4>Cheating in Relationship</h4>
             <p>“We have been together for 5 years and it was happening right under my nose and I didnt even realise. I trusted him with all my heart. Not just as a partner, but as a human being. How could he stoop so low to cheat and break my trust like this?”</p>

          <h4>Cheating in Marriage</h4>
              <p>Cheating in a marriage is a devastating and an emotionally painful experience. Many couples part ways and marriages get torn apart due to infidelity. It is hard to imagine that something like this could actually happen to us and first and foremost there is a feeling of shock.</p>

          <h4>Friendship</h4>
             <p>Friendships are an important part of our lives as we share so much with them. Sometimes due to time constrains, ego clashes, miscommunication & certain other factors our friendships tend to become sour. With a little trust, understanding and communication, such differences can be resolved and we can continue to cherish and celebrate friendship.</p>

           <h4>Couples Counseling</h4>
             <p>A lot of couples tend to seek therapy as a final resort or a last ditch attempt when nothing else seems to be working for them. According to a research by Gottman Institute, couples tend to wait a minimum of 6 years of being dissatisfied before they decide to seek help.</p>
<br><br>
             <h2 align="center">2. Counseling for Stress, Anxiety and Depression</h2>
                <p>“It’s not the load that breaks you down, but its the way you carry it”

Various transitions or events in life bring stressors and triggers that can exceed our coping ability. Like- loss of friendships family members loved ones, marriage, being a caregiver, moving to a new place or a role of being a parent spouse or a job position.

Stress and anxiety share similar physical symptoms like sleep and appetite changes, fatigue, body pains, irritability, poor attention. The difference lies in the cause. Stress is our body’s response to a tangible, present threat whereas anxiety is a perceived threat regarding the future. Stress is usually a temporary experience and is overcome once the cause has been resolved. Anxiety can be long-lasting.

Anxiety is experienced in terms of constant, persistent and intrusive worry. You could find yourself experiencing anxiety in response to a situation such as an interview or stage performance. Many times you may be able to overcome the stress and tension that accompanies anxiety but when you see your relationships, work and overall functioning getting impacted is when you must seek professional help.

What may be stressful for one person may not be the same for another, it has a unique presentation in every individual hence the therapy is also tailored according to your concerns.</p>

              <h3>Therapy Approach</h3>  
                 <p>
                    <ul>
              <li>Your counselor will spend the initial part of the therapy in building a rapport with you and giving you a safe, non-judgemental atmosphere to share your concerns.</li>
            
              <li>The counselor would then be understanding the symptoms that you are exhibiting in order to clearly differentiate whether it is stress or anxiety. They will ask you relevant questions on your recent concerns and identify the triggers to these experiences. While doing this the counselor may ask you to make a journal of your triggers and your ways of coping with them. This helps in identifying the source of your stress and anxiety and get more information to help you.
</li>
              <li>Anxiety and stress both tend to impact concentration and attention span. At times it becomes too overwhelming to focus on the task at hand. It may also be causing you to procrastinate thus creating a vicious cycle. Your counselor would then help you with challenging the procrastinating pattern, increasing your motivation, breaking the goals into small achievable ones.</li>

              <li>You may find noticeable changes after a few sessions where you would be able to identify triggers, implement relaxation techniques and able to challenge the unproductive thoughts.</li>

              <li>Many times stress and anxiety are clubbed with other issues like lack of self-confidence, self-doubt, poor decision-making skills, etc. The counselor would be taking up these concerns one at a time as you progress, bringing lifestyle changes in your routine such as improving sleep hygiene, developing an exercise routine to bring a holistic change.</li>

              <li>The aim of the counselor is to empower you in your journey of overcoming stress and anxiety. It is recommended to have 10-12 sessions to have lasting changes</li>
</ul>
</p>

              <h4>Depression & Tension</h4>  
                <p>Tension or Stress is the natural response of the body to any form of discomforting event that we might endure. It can be positive that is Eustress and help us in giving our optimal performance or it can be negative i.e. Distress and have deleterious impact on various domains of our life.

</p>
       
               <h4>Anxiety</h4>
                 <p>“Anxiety is repeatedly re-experiencing failure in advance” –Seth Godin. When we are unsure how to stop the worry cycle and feel it is beyond our control, even though we usually realize that our anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants, it can hamper various aspects of our life such as work, relationships etc .Adopting a more positive attitude can improve the quality of our life.</p>
 
               <h4>Trauma & PTSD</h4> 
                 <p>It is important to understand what you could be going through, in order to deal and combat with it effectively. Trauma is an experience, that often is reserved for events that have been validated to induce high distress. Infact Trauma is a response to any event that may be distressing to an individual according to their subjective reality.</p>

               <h4>Peer Pressure</h4>
                 <p>Peer pressure is direct influence on people by peers, or an individual who gets encouraged to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values, or behaviors to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. Our peer group values and attitudes influence, more strongly than do family values.</p>
     
               <h4>Financial Stress</h4> 
                 <p>Financial stress affects more than our wallet as it is linked to sleep problems, anxiety and a variety of undesirable emotions.The uncertainty of the future keeps us in an infinite loop of stress and anxiety that gives us sleepless nights. In such a situation, let us focus on what can be done rather than what cannot be. Only a healthy mind can generate a healthy solution.</p>

               <h4>Discrimination & Racism</h4> 
                 <p>We all deserve to be treated fairly and equally. It’s human to want to have a sense of belongingness, to want to fit in and to want to be accepted for who we are. As we evolve at a society level we will face discrimination in some or the other form, be it Cast, Color, Gender, Economic Status etc. but we can all learn to deal with it and not let it affect our happiness.</p>
<br><br>
            <h2 align="center">3. Self Esteem and Confidence</h2>
              <p>We are all inherently born worthy but some experiences make us question it

Self-worth, self-care, and self-esteem have become the new catchphrases with the rise in mental health awareness.

Our self-worth has far-reaching consequences and becomes the lens through which we see ourselves, other and the world in general. Low self-worth creeps up in both personal and professional spheres. It defines the way our interactions with others are shaped.</p>
<br>

</div><br>
                         <h3>Therapy Approach</h3>  
                 <p>
                    <ul>
                <li>Explore the origin of low self-worth-
Criticising parents, discouraging teachers, bullying, academic failures, professional setbacks are some of the major contributing factors for low self-worth.</li>

                 <li>Restore Self Confidence-
Confidence is built like a muscle through different approaches like- any negative automatic thought regarding self is explored and challenged. List of strengths and accomplishments are made as reminders during low phases. Positive affirmations and letter writing are used to nourish self-love.

</li>

               <li>Incorporate Self Care activities-
Mental and physical self-care activities are incorporated in daily routine.</li>

              <li>Boundary Setting-
Usually people with low self-confidence place others’ needs above their own in order to keep the relationship intact. It is out of fear rather than love. Boundary setting helps to place healthy limits and build emotionally secure relationships.</li>

          <li>Positive Self- Talk-
Negative self-talk and the inner critic is replaced with a compassionate, nurturing, supportive inner voice.

</li>

        <li>Pitfalls-
Even after self-worth is built, it can be impacted by life-changing events like break up/divorce, loss of a job, physical disability and hence needs to be worked upon continuously.</li>
</ul>
</p>

            <h4>Enhance Confidence</h4> 
             <p>Image is an integral aspect of our personality. Especially during our teenage years and youth, we may tend to focus on our flaws more than thinking about what’s good and unique about us. We also overlook the beauty that lies in being differentand one of a kind. Celebrating our individuality can help us improve our self-image.</p> 

            <h4>Interaction with Opposite Sex</h4>
             <p>Interactions with opposite sex may not come very naturally to us. We may feel shy, nervous or intimidated when we have to interact with the opposite sex. These feelings usually originate from an underlying unfamiliarity or fear of being judged, disliked or rejected. To be happy and confident, it's important to feel good about who we are. Gradual exposure can help build comfort and confidence.</p>  

            <h4>Inferiority Complex</h4>
             <p>We have all gone through phases where we weren’t fully confident of our abilities and have felt smaller than others. Alternatively, we may experience excessive confidence and feel superior to others. Both of these complexes are natural. With a little help, we can manage these and try to avoid the stress that follows.</p>  

            <h4>Personality Development</h4>
             <p>“Personality is to a man, what perfume is to a flower”.Developing, grooming and enhancing one’s inner and outer self brings about a positive change in one’s life. A powerful and well-rounded personality accelerates success and popularity in all walks of life</p>  

           <h4>Bullying</h4>
             <p>It is the use of force, threat, or coercion to abuse, intimidate, or aggressively dominate others. Being picked on and made fun of is a troubling experience and one’s self-esteem and confidence take a hit when bullied. Intervention and support by teachers, peers and parents can make a huge difference.</p>  

           <h4>Body Image</h4>
            <p>In a world where appearances are taken as a vital parameter of judgment & evaluation, consciousness and stress pertaining to body image is inevitable. It is the need of the hour to learn to accept how we are & stop validating ourselves by our outward appearances. We are so much more than what meets the eye</p>
